        "1. Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects created from the class can have.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Object: An instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with attributes and behaviors defined by its class.\n",

        "3. Encapsulation: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting access to some components of an object to ensure controlled modification (using access modifiers like private, public, or protected).\n",

        "5. Polymorphism: The ability to present the same interface or method in different forms. This can be achieved through method overriding (inherited methods in a subclass) and method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class)."
